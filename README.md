# yubikey-agent

yubikey-agent is a seamless ssh-agent for YubiKeys.

* **Easy to use.** A one-command setup, one environment variable, and it just runs in the background.
* **Indestructible.** Tolerates unplugging, sleep, and suspend. Never needs restarting.
* **Compatible.** Provides a public key that works with all services and servers.
* **Secure.** The key is generated on the YubiKey and can't be extracted. Every session requires the PIN, every login requires a touch. Setup takes care of PUK and management key.

Written in pure Go, it's based on [github.com/go-piv/piv-go](https://github.com/go-piv/piv-go) and [golang.org/x/crypto/ssh](https://golang.org/x/crypto/ssh).

## Installation

### macOS

```
brew tap filippo.io/yubikey-agent https://filippo.io/yubikey-agent
brew install yubikey-agent
brew services start yubikey-agent

yubikey-agent -setup # generate a new key on the YubiKey
```

Then add the following line to your `~/.zshrc` and restart the shell.

```
export SSH_AUTH_SOCK="/usr/local/var/run/yubikey-agent.sock"
```

### Linux

#### Arch

On Arch, use [the `yubikey-agent` package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/yubikey-agent/) from the AUR.

```
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yubikey-agent.git
cd yubikey-agent && makepkg -si

systemctl daemon-reload --user
sudo systemctl enable --now pcscd.socket
systemctl --user enable --now yubikey-agent

export SSH_AUTH_SOCK="${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/yubikey-agent/yubikey-agent.sock"
```

#### NixOS / nixpkgs

On NixOS unstable and 20.09 (unreleased at time of writing), you can
add this to your `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix`:

```
services.yubikey-agent.enable = true;
```

This installs `yubikey-agent` and sets up a systemd unit to start
yubikey-agent for you.

On other systems using nix, you can also install from nixpkgs:

```
nix-env -iA nixpkgs.yubikey-agent
```

This installs the software but does *not* install a systemd unit.  You
will have to set up service management manually (see below).

#### Other systemd-based Linux systems

On other systemd-based Linux systems, follow [the manual installation instructions](systemd.md).

Packaging contributions are very welcome.

### FreeBSD

Install the [`yubikey-agent` port](https://svnweb.freebsd.org/ports/head/security/yubikey-agent/).

### Windows

Windows support is currently WIP.

## Advanced topics

### Coexisting with other `ssh-agent`s

It's possible to configure `ssh-agent`s on a per-host basis.

For example to only use `yubikey-agent` when connecting to `example.com`, you'd add the following lines to `~/.ssh/config` instead of setting `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`.

```
Host example.com
    IdentityAgent /usr/local/var/run/yubikey-agent.sock
```

To use `yubikey-agent` for all hosts but one, you'd add the following lines instead. In both cases, you can keep using `ssh-add` to interact with the main `ssh-agent`.

```
Host example.com
    IdentityAgent $SSH_AUTH_SOCK

Host *
    IdentityAgent /usr/local/var/run/yubikey-agent.sock
```

### Conflicts with `gpg-agent` and Yubikey Manager

`yubikey-agent` takes a persistent transaction so the YubiKey will cache the PIN after first use. Unfortunately, this makes the YubiKey PIV and PGP applets unavailable to any other applications, like `gpg-agent` and Yubikey Manager. Our upstream [is investigating solutions to this annoyance](https://github.com/go-piv/piv-go/issues/47).

If you need `yubikey-agent` to release its lock on the YubiKey, send it a hangup signal. Likewise, you might have to kill `gpg-agent` after use for it to release its own lock.

```
killall -HUP yubikey-agent
```

This does not affect the FIDO2 functionality.

### Unblocking the PIN with the PUK

If the wrong PIN is entered incorrectly three times in a row, YubiKey Manager can be used to unlock it.

`yubikey-agent -setup` sets the PUK to the same value as the PIN.

```
ykman piv unblock-pin
```

If the PUK is also entered incorrectly three times, the key is permanently irrecoverable. The YubiKey PIV applet can be reset with `yubikey-agent -setup --really-delete-all-piv-keys`.

### Retrieving the management key

`yubikey-agent` sets a new PIV management key, and then stores it in the pin-protected key metadata. If you need to retrieve it (for example, to modify the pin/puk retries with `ykman`, you can do so with `yubikey-agent -get-management-key`.

### Manual setup and technical details

`yubikey-agent` only officially supports YubiKeys set up with `yubikey-agent -setup`.

In practice, any PIV token with an RSA or ECDSA P-256 key and certificate in the Authentication slot should work, with any PIN and touch policy. Simply skip the setup step and use `ssh-add -L` to view the public key.

`yubikey-agent -setup` generates a random Management Key and [stores it in PIN-protected metadata](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-piv/piv-go/piv?tab=doc#YubiKey.SetMetadata).

### Alternatives

#### Native FIDO2

Recent versions of OpenSSH [support using FIDO2 tokens as keys](https://buttondown.email/cryptography-dispatches/archive/cryptography-dispatches-openssh-82-just-works/). Since those are their own key type, they require server-side support, which is currently not available in Debian stable or on GitHub.

FIDO2 keys also usually don't require a PIN, but depending on the token can require a private key file. `yubikey-agent` keys can be ported to a different machine simply by plugging in the YubiKey.

#### `gpg-agent`

`gpg-agent` can act as an `ssh-agent`, and it can use keys stored on the PGP applet of a YubiKey.

This requires a finicky setup process dealing with PGP keys and the `gpg` UX, and seems to lose track of the YubiKey and require restarting all the time. Frankly, I had enough of PGP and GnuPG.

#### `ssh-agent` and PKCS#11

`ssh-agent` can load PKCS#11 applets to interact with PIV tokens directly. There are two third-party PKCS#11 providers for YubiKeys (OpenSC and ykcs11) and one that ships with macOS (`man 8 ssh-keychain`).

The UX of this solution is poor: it requires calling `ssh-add` to load the PKCS#11 module and to unlock it with the PIN (as the agent has no way of requesting input from the client during use, a limitation that `yubikey-agent` handles with `pinentry`), and needs manual reloading every time the YubiKey is unplugged or the machine goes to sleep.

The ssh-agent that ships with macOS (which is pretty cool, as it starts on demand and is preconfigured in the environment) also has restrictions on where the `.so` modules can be loaded from. It can see through symlinks, so a Homebrew-installed `/usr/local/lib/libykcs11.dylib` won't work, while a hard copy at `/usr/local/lib/libykcs11.copy.dylib` will.

`/usr/lib/ssh-keychain.dylib` works out of the box, but only with RSA keys. Key generation is undocumented.

#### SeKey

[SeKey](https://github.com/sekey/sekey) is a similar project that uses the Secure Enclave to store the private key and Touch ID for authorization.

#### `pivy-agent`

[`pivy-agent`](https://github.com/joyent/pivy#using-pivy-agent) is part of a suite of tools to work with PIV tokens. It's similar to `yubikey-agent`, and inspired its design.

The main difference is that it requires unlocking via `ssh-add -X` rather than using a graphical pinentry, and it caches the PIN in memory rather than relying on the device PIN policy. It's also written in C.

`yubikey-agent` also aims to provide an even smoother setup process.
